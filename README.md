# Digital-Clock
I've created a Java-based digital clock that displays real-time hours and minutes in a user-friendly digital format. The clock utilizes Java's time-handling functionalities, providing an accurate and visually clear representation of the current time. 

Compile it by the command: javac App.java  <br>
Run type command: java App
